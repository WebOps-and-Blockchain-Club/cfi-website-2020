          3D Printing Club was started in the year 2015 with the vision of
          promoting a new form of manufacturing technology among the students
          and driving research and innovation in the field of 3D Printing. The
          3D Printing Club currently houses multiple 3D printers. Few of them
          were built during the 3D Printing Summer School conducted over the
          years with the support of the open source 3D printing community. We
          undertake projects in collaboration with the other clubs in CFI to
          produce tailor-made industrial grade parts. The 3D printer is located
          at the CFI facility and can be commissioned by the students of IIT
          Madras.

          Flying is an irresistible passion for all of us!
          <br />
          <br />
          Being one of the earliest clubs to be founded in CFI, the club has
          envisioned the dream to fly . The club witnesses active participation
          with members from diverse branches of engineering and of different age
          groups. Regular workshops and timely meetings have kept the club
          active throughout. The club has witnessed glories in a number of
          national and international competitions like IARC (International
          Aerial Robotics Competition), with the best design award bagged by
          IITM ; NAL MICAV (Micro Air Vehicle Flying Competition), etc.
          <br />
          <br />
          Some of the initial projects include ‘Want To Fly’ for the flying
          enthusiasts out there that involved making and flying of RC and IC
          engine planes. Then came up projects like{" "}
          <strong>
            Twin Engine Plane, VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing), Foam
            planes, Quadrotors & Hexacopters , RC SPAD (Radio Controlled Simple
            Plastic Aircraft Design), Flying Wing & Delta Wing Aircraft, Auto
            Gyro, Ball Drone
          </strong>
          and so on. The club is currently working on the development of a
          miniature model of a flying insect, <strong>WASP</strong>. Among the
          other projects are <strong>CarCopter</strong>, a drone for the land as
          well as air and <strong>Modular Plane</strong>, a single plane with
          multiple adjustable configurations.
          <br />
          <br />
          Some of the socially relevant contributions include using a Hexacopter
          to help the Chennai Police solve a criminal case. With constant
          innovation and efforts the club has supplemented its members with the
          skills of aero-modeling and Radio Control. Shortly, the club is making
          stride towards attaining the realm of professionalism with increasing
          industrial contacts and overwhelming participation.

          <br />
          <br />
          The Astronomy club IIT Madras is the oldest of all clubs present.
          Students and campus residents alike have been fascinated by the roof
          of stars that houses us, and this is what lead to the formation of the
          club.
          <br />
          <br />
          Recently we decided to move towards the Physics aspect of our world –
          everything from the world of subatomic particles to galaxies. And now,
          the club stands tall as the Physics and Astronomy club rechristened as
          “Horizon”.
          <br />
          <br />

          <strong className="quote">Observation Sessions:</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          Over time, we have conducted many observation sessions, some very
          generic, and some special – on occasions of rare celestial phenomena.
          We have had some very successful sessions, including spotting Comet
          Lovejoy, catching a brief glimpse of the lunar eclipse in September
          2015, 3 days and nights of the Great Planetary alignment, Mars
          opposition, and the session on the Mercury transit. Last year we had a
          turnout of over 500 people for our Lunar Eclipse event. We also
          conducted a hands on telescope session last year.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong className="quote">Projects:</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          We have an entire page dedicated to the projects being
          undertaken/previously done by our club members, and they can be found
          here.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong className="quote">Trips:</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          We also conduct trips to various research labs and sky gazing spots
          for astronomical events . The first documented trip was to Rameshwaram
          for the observation of solar eclipse, in 2009. We then organized a
          trip for Institute people (students and Alumni) to Yelagiri, to
          perform one-night observation of the heavens above, and also try out
          astrophotography. With support from CFI, and Dr. Suresh Mohan, whom we
          look up to as our mentor, we pulled off a trip for around 40 people,
          and were able to capture some deep sky objects on the screen! The
          students were enthralled to see the Milky way in the sky, not to
          mention the wandering meteors which fascinated many.Last year, we
          conducted a trip to the Vainu Bappu observatory, where we got to see
          their 93” telescope and use the 14’’ telescope for astrophotography.
          We also observed deep sky and messier objects.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong className="quote">Workshops & Lectures:</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          We have conducted various workshops and lectures for the benefit of
          not only the students of the institute but also for the campus
          residents and people all over India, mainly as a part of Shaastra, the
          technical festival of IIT Madras.
          <br />
          <br />
          We have had workshops on various subjects, most notably the
          Astronomical Data analysis workshop, wherein we taught more than 150
          students data analysis of Sloan Digital Sky Survey data, which is one
          of the most extensive databases in the world. For Shaastra 2018, we
          conducted an observation workshop and a coding workshop on
          astronomical calculations. Last year, We have had several lectures by
          notable scholars in the field of physics like Prof. V Balakrishnan who
          gave a talk on the ‘Dynamical Symmetry in the Kepler problem’ and
          Prof. Bharat Ratra who gave a talk on Cosmology.

        <p className="description">
          The Computer Vision Group of IIT Madras was started on September 2009
          with a vision of building a team of students with deep expertise in
          the technology of Computer Vision. The idea for the formation of such
          a club was seeded in 2008 when the IIT Madras team had represented
          India at the International Aerial Robotics Competition (IARC). CVG
          which competed against elite teams, from other top Universities in
          IARC 2009, was acknowledged as the best vision team among all the
          participating teams.
          <br />
          <br />
          Being the only club out of which a start-up has grown, CVG has
          extraordinary mentorship and motivated and committed members, who have
          completed Industrial Projects by ITC, The Indian Railways, VDime, Eye
          hospital CHECK and multiple machine learning projects.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Fun with Faces</strong> – This project was a small scale
              attempt at Snapchat with a few filters which would add certain add
              ons to your face. The final version used a library called dlib,
              which provides facial feature points and using a few machine
              learning algorithms, real time results were achieved.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Rubik’s cube solver</strong> – Using images of the sides
              of a Rubik cube, this project will be able to solve it within
              seconds and it will give a 3d simulation and the steps required to
              solve it.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Expression Morphing</strong> – This project could morph
              expressions to one’s face, to make him smile or frown. It used a
              few libraries which would help obtain the facial keypoints and
              after a certain lines of code provided a final image which would
              have an expression decided by the user.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cell Boundary Identification</strong> – This project, was
              a part of Government of India’s innovation challenge. It aims at
              automated identification of cell boundaries from the pathological
              slides. This holds a tremendous potential for cancer diagnosis. It
              involves decomposing a video of the sample into frames and
              identifying cell boundaries.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Face Recognition</strong>– This project is a part of CFI
              Jarvis which aims at making the new CFI building smart. This
              project focuses on the security features of the new building. It
              will continuously scan the environment and grants access to those
              who have been registered in the database of users. Future features
              will include face search through the institute database and alerts
              in the case of an attempt to breach security protocols.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Voice App Control</strong> – This project, uses one’s
              voice to control mobile phone apps. By using Natural Language
              Processing techniques, this app will be able to seamlessly control
              your phone’s interface.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>AutoCaption</strong> – This project, as the name suggests,
              automatically provides captions to an input image using state of
              the art neural networks. It also provides hashtags.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Video Stabilization for UAVs</strong> – The primary
              objective of the project is to ensure proper clarity of a video
              taken from a moving camera source. This will help in retrieving
              useful features which otherwise will be rendered useless due to
              camera shake.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Evaluation of OMR</strong> – Using computer vision and
              machine learning techniques, one could make the process of
              evaluating the OMR easier and more accurate compared to the
              traditional methods that currently exist.

          The iBot Club is home to many of Insti’s robotics enthusiasts who
          spend a great chunk of their time in designing and prototyping robots
          which can perform any required task. We also organize regular
          workshops to inspire students across varied technical backgrounds to
          develop their ideas and expose them to the wonders of robotics. One of
          our workshops organized in conjunction with Swissnex Robotics India,
          on underwater robotics, was a great success and got extended press
          coverage as well. Experts from the Autonomous Systems Lab ETH Zurich,
          came down to IIT Madras to conduct this workshop.
          <br />
          <br />
          Apart from these, we mentor several student projects throughout the
          year. Last year, our projects included developing a wall climbing
          robot, a smart walking stick for assisting blind people, a water can
          lifting robot, a smart locking mechanism, a self-balancing platform
          and a glass cleaning robot. One of our previous projects, a home
          automation system based on the Internet of Things won the gold medal
          in the Inter-IIT Tech Meet 2016.

          <br />
          This project aims to make a non-line of sight bot that follows
          specific human (target) while dodging all obstacles in its way. Its
          long-term goal is to make a humanoid, for the first time ever in the
          history of CFI, that would follow and imitate human beings!

          <br />
          The Railroad Crack Detection Bot, named after the Greek goddess,
          Artemis, known for the protection of the innocent, treads along the
          inside of a rail track and using ultrasonic technology, it detects
          cracks big enough to cause derailments and saves the data. When it
          reaches the earmarked station, we would retrieve the data and initiate
          repair work at the earliest.

          tree is risky and humongous. The palm tree climber is a Bluetooth
          controlled and automated bot with a robotic arm that would climb trees
          and harvest products, eliminating the need for humans to risk their
          lives in doing so.

          Though manhole scavenging was banned in 2013, it is still in practice.
          In 2017, about 300 people have died because of this. Unlike the
          currently used man scavenging and costly cranes, this Bot uses a fast
          and efficient way of cleaning manholes which is also cost effective
          and easy to use. The long-term goal of this project is to market the
          product successfully and completely eradicate the practice of manhole

        <p className="description">
          <strong className="quote">Vision</strong>
          The pleasure one experiences by helping someone in need is invaluable
          and the level of contentment of such achievements is extremely high.
          <br />
          <br />
          Sahaay, as the name suggests, aims to develop technological products
          and to provide technical solutions to assist specially-abled people in
          their daily lives. The vision is to establish a team of enthusiastic
          students which would collaborate with various NGOs and work towards
          development of technologies as solutions that greatly impact the
          society.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong className="quote">Previous projects</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          Firstly, Sahaay has collaborated with an NGO named Vidyasagar, which
          works for the welfare of a set of children with cerebral palsy. After
          performing detailed case studies on every child, with higher priority
          for outgoing children, their need for specific devices which can
          assist as a source of income has been identified. Presently, Sahaay
          has successfully developed four products (including two software
          products) and served a requirement of additional equipment for a
          wheelchair. The details are as follows:
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>1. Block Printing device</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          Products like printed paper bags made by specially-abled children
          value a lot to the public. This can be perceived as a good source of
          income for these children and is, hence, considered as one of the
          projects with high priority. The project aims to build a block
          printing device. This consists of a series of block printers capable
          of printing a paper of predefined size. A roll of paper would be fed
          into the machine and the printing action can be achieved through
          slightest mechanical action affordable by the children.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>2. Bill generator software</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          Most of these children are able to lift or press objects to little
          extent. A device that converts these actions into mouse-clicks has
          been developed by a group in team Sahaay. The requirements of the NGO
          were to design and develop a software by just using these mouse-clicks
          to generate bills based on inputs given from a device. The user can,
          now, be able to select various items and their respective quantities
          before generating the bill.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>3. Leap Motion games</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          Leap Motion controller developed by Leap Motion Inc. is a
          revolutionary controller to give input to PCs and Laptops. It tracks
          movements of hand and fingers of the user to give inputs to the apps
          developed especially for it. The teachers at the NGO wish to use a
          Leap motion Controller to allow these kids to play games. The problem
          being faced with the existing games is the need of very intricate
          gestures which are difficult for these students to perform. The aim of
          this project is to develop games or interfaces which can be part of
          their recreational activities.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>4. Paper punching machine</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          As mentioned earlier, paper toys or decorative pieces made by these
          students are valued a lot by the society and thus, paper punching
          machine also becomes one of the crucial projects. The project aims at
          designing a device that can be used to punch various designs on paper.
          A roll of paper is fed into the machine which would be capable of
          continuously punching out designs on paper.
          <br />
          The following projects are initiated in collaboration with Dr. Dathu
          Rao Memorial Charitable Trust, part of an NGO called Pathway
          Organisation, brought forward by Mrs. Sudha Subramaniam (Program
          Director)
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>5. Design of an Electrolarynx</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          People who have lost their larynx (voice box) due to cancer or any
          other reason, have three possibilities of talking that include using
          Esophageal Speech, Artificial Larynx or Tracheoesophageal Puncture. Of
          the three, the widely used artificial larynx method uses an external
          device called Electrolarynx. The Electrolarynx produces vibrations at
          a frequency as per requirement, which the person uses for articulating
          words.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>
            6. Android Applications for Assistance of Autistic Children
          </strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          A set of android applications developed to assist the autistic
          children communicate with other people and help the therapists assess
          and monitor their progress. These applications would help the children
          in completing their daily activities and express their needs and
          desires based on recognition of pictures, which would then inform the
          therapist. It would also help the therapist in keeping track of
          certain parameters which are universally recognized, to assess the
          performance of the children and accordingly design programmes for
          them.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong className="quote">Current Projects</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>1. Mechanical Rehabilitation WorkBench</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          A completely mechanical device which helps in the rehabilitation
          process of patients suffering from Cerebral Palsy, Stroke or any other
          form of muscle atrophy. The device would help the patient in
          exercising their upper extremities and at the same time improving
          their hand-leg co-ordination. It would also consist of real time
          muscle monitoring sensors to help the physiotheparist in analysing the
          improvement of the patient.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>2. Toilet Sanitation Mechanism</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          The idea is to develop a completely mechanical mechanism which could
          be used as an add-on to any existing western commode and be used to
          sanitize and wipe the toilet seat. This kind of a mechanism can be
          widely used in public places, offices and public transport.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>3. Assistive Device for the Visually Challenged</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          Development of an add-on device which could be placed on footwear and
          glow at night and in dark areas to help people with poor vision see
          and navigate in the dark.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>4. Aquatic Weed Removal Mechanism</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          Design of a completely mechanical mechanism which could be used to
          remove large volume of weed from the periphery of the water body thus
          helping in cleaning and restoration.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>5. Automatic Waste Segregation Dustbin</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          Done in collaboration with the CVG group of CFI, this project aims to
          design and develop an Automatic Waste Segregation Dustbin based on
          Artificial Intelligence. The dustbin is being designed for domestic
          use and would tackle the major issues of waste segregation in the
          country.

          The Annual Technical Festival of IIT Madras, Shaastra introduced a
          technologically aided cultural show in the year 2013, capitalizing on
          the entertainment factor. That techno – cultural show was named{" "}

          student organised techno-entertainment show. The projects which were
          exhibited in former editions of Envisage attracted a bunch of
          not-so-technically oriented guests too. The projects were designed in
          conformity with the tagline of Envisage –{" "}
          <strong>“Technology meets Entertainment”</strong>. Organisers of
          Envisage decided to widen its boundaries beyond Shaastra and founded a

          deployed, is in the very near future. Swarm technology is an approach
          to coordination of bots within a multi bot system. It was inspired by
          studying ants and other tiny organisms to know their behavior and
          apply the same to make multiple robots coordinate to perform a certain
          task.
