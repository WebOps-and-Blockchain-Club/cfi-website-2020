              also developed a state of the art path-planning algorithm based on
              RRT which has been done by only a handful of companies. The team
              has developed algorithms for lane detection and computer vision
              that are comparable to the best in the world. Their prototype is
              so energy efficient that a single battery of 25 Volts can power
              the vehicle for more than two hours.
