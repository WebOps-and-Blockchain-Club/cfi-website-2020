            The CFI Open House is CFI's flagship event conducted to showcase the
            recent work and achievements of our student innovators, as well as
            providing an opportunity for their projects to be displayed on a
            large scale, leading to implementation.
            <br />
            <br />
            It also serves as a platform for networking with experts and
            prominent industrialists who facilitate innovation in technology and
            entrepreneurship and get ideas on how to proceed.
            <br />
            <br />
            It also helps the project members to understand how well their idea
            is received by the general public so that they will get the
            motivation to work harder and complete their project. (since a lot
            of projects in CFI have a potential to be useful to the society or
            the environment)
            <br />
            <br />
            CFI Open House is an opportunity for students to network with
            potential mentors and facilitators in the field of technology and
            entrepreneurship. In the years since its inception, CFI has grown as
            a hub for innovation, on multiple occasions collaborating with
            industries and nurturing hundreds of student-proposed projects that
            have bagged honourable awards, internationally recognised
            competition teams and some of the nation's most acknowledged
            startups.
            <br />
            <br />
            CFI’s open house is the fruit of days and days of hardwork infused
            with passion for making the world into a better place to live.
            Students explain what they did not just by words but by displaying
            their creation in action! It’s great to see so many people adding to
            their joy by showing up, listening and watching in awe, their
            creation and effort.
            <br />
            <br />
            It is the ultimate platform to help realise CFI's motto of Walk in
            with an idea and walk out with an end product
